\section{Algorithms}

Things i will include here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item List of Algorithms we spoke about with their complexity
	\item List of problems we talked about and their NP class, and any approximations that could be found
	\item Intuitions behind proofs and algorithms in order to understand them better
	\item Different design approaches and what examples we used in class, to remember them better
\end{itemize}
\section{Reinforcement Learning}
Things to be included here, this might be in a separate pdf in order to be printed. For each chapter, there will be the algorithms written succinctly and their comparison with other stuff and a bit of discussion on their usage. Also exercises will be worked on and compared with existing solutions.
