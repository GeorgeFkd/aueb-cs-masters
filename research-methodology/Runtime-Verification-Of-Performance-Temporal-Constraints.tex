\section{Introduction}
A general thing about formal methods, then a bit about runtime verification, the associate it with event based systems, then show that RV + EBS is about temporal constraints checking on events.Our contributions lie in embedding performance awareness in the existing model introduced by [_]. This extension is not limited to the current model, but any model that considers temporal constraints based on the axiomatic interval relationships by Allan <>.
\section{Related Work}
This is where the few papers i have read will be laid out. Around 10 will be discussed here
\section{Modelling Performance with Temporal Constraints}
This is where we will discuss our model formalism to extend the current model to have performance considerations
\par
This is where we will discuss how we can transform performance constraints indicated above into temporal constraints.
\par
This is where we will discuss the algorithms of [_] that we get by doing this transformation/reduction.
\par
This is where we will discuss how can performance be checked in a continuous online manner and where it makes sense to do so.

\section{Tool Implementation}
Architecture Diagram, a bit of discussion about the technology choice and some details.
\section{Case Study}
This is where a simple case study will be done, regarding cloud resources and QoS guarantees.
