### Natural Language Processing(NLP)
Prof. [Ion Androutsopoulos](https://www.aueb.gr/el/faculty_page/%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%84%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%99%CF%89%CE%BD-%CE%99%CF%89%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82)

Learned about different AI learning models and related concepts and applied them to NLP tasks.
Below is an overview of things we learned:

1. Traditional Language Models(N-grams)
2. Features(TF-IDF,SVD,PMI,K-Means) and Evaluation Metrics
3. Regression (Linear and Multinomial)
4. MLPs with SGD for text classification and token classification(+ different normalisations), Word2Vec
5. RNNs(+Bidirectional and Stacked ones) with GRUs/LSTMs for cells, Self Attention
6. CNNs 
7. Transformers and LLMs
8. Speech recognition basics

#### Exam Style (2024-2025)
Studying the given solved exercises will get you far(the exams do not include anything code related).

In our year it had: Calculations from N-grams, prompt engineering, derivation for backpropagation, Dimensions of layers in a complex model(plenty of examples given from his exercises), the part with BeRT and masking words to make it learn new stuff, MLP as attention head to train an existing model for a given task.

### Blockchains
Prof. [Spyros Voulgaris](https://www.aueb.gr/el/faculty_page/voylgaris-spyridon)

Learned about blockchains and cryptocurrencies in their algorithmic and design level as protocols and systems(no, you will not make money from crypto by taking this course). 

Main topics were **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Consensus protocols** and communication between different ledgers. 
It was heavy on discussing the design decisions, how incentives work, how the peer to peer nature and decentralisation are achieved through cryptographic tools and distributed protocols. 
We did not get deep into cryptography, only learned some related concepts wherever they were needed.

#### Exam Style (2024-2025)

Questions related to WHY things in blockchains are made that way, why do we need certain things, how could we implement a specific thing using blockchains, what would happen to a system if we removed something etc. etc. 

Ofc you will not write code as part of the exam.

### Reinforcement Learning(RL)
Prof. [Stavros Toumpis](https://www.aueb.gr/el/faculty_page/%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%B7%CF%83-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83)

We followed the book of Sutton and Barton on RL and got up to Q-Learning and n-step bootstrapping.
The things we learned were:

- Dynamic Programming Methods
- Finite Markov Decision Processes
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA, Q-Learning)
- N-step bootstrapping


#### Exam Style (2024-2025)
Exercises from the book itself, nothing more. Properly studying from the book should be enough(working out proofs and doing the exercises).

### Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Prof. [Markakis](https://www.aueb.gr/el/faculty_page/%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%83-%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83)
Great course, helpful for really diving deeper into algorithms and should help with LeetCode style 
problems as you get to use each problem-solving methodology on different problems(but only write pseudocode,
if you are interested implement them in actual code).

Topics:

Different Methodologies and Design Strategies for Algorithms, mixed with a bit of theory related to algorithms. 

- Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms(+Flows and Matchings)
- P,NP,reductions, and approximation algorithms
- Tackling NP problems (TSP,Set Cover,Vertex Cover, Subset Sum, Job Scheduling, Knapsack)
- Bits of Linear and Integer Programming (and how we can use them to create algorithms)
- Randomised Algorithms

#### Exam Style (2024-2025)
Exercises like the ones in the assignments, they are tough because the time is limited, you need to get them right the first time eyou will not have time to revisit things. 
Focus on solving problems not just reading the theory (also remember all the problems
and their formulations, it is useful.).
