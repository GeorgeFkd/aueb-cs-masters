\paragraph{Questions}

I need to see what they have implemented. Have they done the byte level compression and now i have to reduce the amount of bytes we send by implementing techniques that are domain-specific for 3D video right? So my job here is to see what data will actually be encoded and then decoded on the other end right? I dont touch the codec and other compressions. My whole premise is to go from byte[] to smaller byte[] right?
