	abstract = {Point cloud streaming is a key component of 5G (and beyond) networks, serving as a foundation for holographic communication. While it enables immersive experiences, it also poses significant challenges to network infrastructure. Uncompressed point cloud streams produce Gbps traffic volumes, while compressed streams often suffer from multi-second latencies. Therefore, the feasibility of real-time applications that require ultra-low motion-to-eye latency, such as Network Music Performance and Remote Driving, remains unclear. In this work, we design and implement a novel point cloud streaming tool, based on the Draco encoder, Intel’s RealSense SDK, and OpenGL. We deploy our prototype implementation in a private 5G stand alone network and provide an indepth analysis of the latency and throughput of point cloud streaming. Our results show that deploying volumetric streaming services over 5G networks is still a challenging task. However, a combination of simple cost-reduction strategies can bring it significantly closer to feasibility.},

While nowadays there is more and more hardware that captures and presents 3D representations of the world, streaming these representations, known as volumetric content, is a key problem to be addressed. Major challenges are related to the transfer of large amounts of unstructured 3D data over bandwidth-limited networks, instant response to users' behavior, i.e. latency compensation, as well as computational complexity at both the server and client devices. To provide an overview of studies conducted in the field of volumetric content streaming, we research relevant literature, summarize different streaming schemes related to this focus. This paper provides a discussion of the challenges of volumetric content streaming, and an overview of the representative volumetric content streaming approaches proposed in the literature to date. Future directions and areas requiring further research are also discussed.},

To realize volumetric video applications, efficient volumetric video streaming is in critical demand. This article responds to the challenges of and proposes solutions to wireless transmission systems of point cloud video, which is the most popular and favored way to represent volumetric media and significantly differs from the other types of videos. In particular, we first introduce point cloud video technology and its applications, and then discuss the challenges of and solutions to point cloud video streaming, including encoding, tiling, viewing angle prediction, decoding, quality assessment and transmission optimization. Furthermore, we explain a prototype of a MPEG DASH-based point cloud video streaming system as a preliminary study, along with more simulation results to verify its performance. Finally, we identify future research directions for providing high-quality point cloud video streaming.},

	abstract = {Video-based Point Cloud Coding (V-PCC) has emerged as the MPEG standard for the compression of dynamic Point Clouds (PC). Instrumental to its success is that it allows transmitting Point Cloud objects over the Internet using the well established methods for video streaming. A key difference, however, to classical video streaming is that at any point in time only a portion of the PC objects in the scene is visible to the user. Hence, streaming an entire object in one encoding quality wastes bandwidth. In this work, we present Normal-separated Video-based Point Cloud Compression (NoVA-PCC) - a method to combine video-based Point Cloud encoding with an object decomposition based on surface normals. In a nutshell, using NoVA-PCC we obtain non-overlapping, separately encoded view-specific segments that can bestreamed independently. This encoding flexibility is then leveraged to guide the streaming client to select the bit rates of the view-specific segments, e.g. to assign higher qualities to better visible PC object parts. Given a fixed available streaming bandwidth we show that this increases the visual quality compared to compressing PC objects at one overall quality. We also show that this degree of freedom of assigning bit rates to view-specific segments allows better utilization of the available streaming bandwidth when compared with a fixed set of predefined overall object qualities. Finally, in the light of dynamic user motion in multi-object scenes, we show the need for accurate user motion prediction to effectively utilize the streaming bandwidth on the visible PC object parts.},

With its six degrees of freedom, it provides viewers with greater immersion and interactivity compared to traditional videos. Despite their potential, volumetric video services pose significant challenges. This survey conducts a comprehensive review of the existing literature on volumetric video. We firstly provide a general framework of volumetric video services, followed by a discussion on prerequisites for volumetric video, encompassing representations, open datasets, and quality assessment metrics. Then we delve into the current methodologies for each stage of the volumetric video service pipeline, detailing capturing, compression, transmission, rendering, and display techniques. Lastly, we explore various applications enabled by this pioneering technology and we present an array of research challenges and opportunities in the domain of volumetric video services. This survey aspires to provide a holistic understanding of this burgeoning field and shed light on potential future research trajectories, aiming to bring the vision of volumetric video to fruition.},
